# Documentation

This directory contains three types of documentation:

1. html/
2. txt/
3. lang/

The first one refers to Doxygen's generated html from
the language source. It is written in html.

The secone one refers to complementary documentation
for the first one. It is written in plain text.

The third one refers to the `docs.sd` git submodule
(which won't be present if this repository is cloned as
`git clone --depth=1`). It is written in markdown and
can be compiled to html using any standard markdown
to html converter (cmark, markdown, pandoc, ...)
