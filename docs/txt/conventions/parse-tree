                    |parse tree|

The SD parse tree is a binary parse tree that implements the use of
DRIVERS and OPERATORS. In general, a BRANCH of the parse tree may
look like:

                           [OP]
                          /    \
               [DRIVER/OP]      [DRIVER/OP]

* a DRIVER is a literal value or a memory address plus its attributes
  (size, interpreted type, etc)
* an OPERATOR is a generalization of anything can perform operations,
  be it arithmetic, bitwise, logical or even syntactical


Code
----

In code, SD uses the `ptree` variable, which has the `struct parse_tree`,
found in `sd/intr/txt/ptree/ptree.h`
