Markup
------

This series of files do not use any special markup language, instead
it uses SECTIONS, UPPERCASE EMPHASIS, HEADERS, BULLET & NUMBERED LISTS,
SUB-SECTIONS, FOOTNOTES, & CODE, all in plain text form.

* Sections are parts of the file separated by headers

  like this
  ---------

  == special sections ==
  * Index
    This section explains the role of files within its directory
  * Sections
    This section explains the role of sections within its file

* Sub-sections are parts of the file wrapped with two equal signs

  == like this ==

* Uppercase emphasis is emphasis using uppercase words

  LIKE THIS

* Headers are sections of text bounded by equal sign horizontal lines

                         =================
                             like this
                         =================

  Headers summarize what the content of the file is about

* Bullet lists are unorded lists

  * like this

  indenting TWO SPACES relative to its parent

  * like this
    * and this

  numbered lists are numeric orderded lists

  1. like this

* Footnotes mark an object THAT IS ITSELF NOT CODE with having a footnote at the
  bottom of the document
                                like this[1]
  [1] : like this

* Code is any piece of text relatively indented with more than two spaces

                                like this

  often ending up in the middle of the document. The specific level of identation
  is irrelevant as long as it is bigger than two relative to its parent's
  level of indentation

  It is the case that INLINED pieces of code may be wrapped with backticks `like this`

The title of the document may be wrapped in pipes |like this|
