\fBsdread\fR [\-i] [[\-s] <file\.\.\.>] [[\-m] <module\.\.\.>] [[\-E] "<expr>"]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBsdread\fR is the default plain\-text & bytecode interpreter for the SD language\.
It wraps around \fBsdparse\.c\fR to handle SDVM's callbacks generated by plain\-text
SD source code and execute them\. It also wraps around \fBsdbcparse\.c\fR to do the
same but with bytecode instead\.

.SH EXPRESSIONS
.P
\fBsdread\fR can be run with an optional expression passed as a \fBsingle argument\fR string\. The \fIobject manager\fR will parse its contents asynchronously from the
main files being passed in and will synchronize them once the main file has
been fully loaded \fBor\fR, if passed the \fB\-E\fR flag, it will parse and execute its content first, then that of the file's\.
.P
Regardless of the parse time, its resultant objects are appended (or prepended)
to the main module root\. If parsing a single file, the main module root is the
file object code\.
If parsing multiple files, the main module root is a bundle of the files\.
If executing a single module or multiple modules, the main module root is a
bundle of the modules\.
.SH NOTES
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Byte default, typeless <file> is of type "\fBsource\fR", aka plain\-text\.
.IP \(bu 2
If \fBsdread\fR is called without any file parameters, it will assume that a
pipe has been opened\. Don't run \fBsdread\fP by itself if you want an interactive
shell\.
